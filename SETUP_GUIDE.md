# Family Creative Projects - Setup Guide

## What We Just Built

Your application now has a **real database backend** connected to Supabase! Here's what's ready:

### ✅ Completed Features
1. **Database Schema** - Three tables ready to store your family's projects
2. **Real Data Loading** - The UI now loads actual projects from the database
3. **Project Creation** - Quick Create buttons now save projects to the database
4. **Family Profiles** - Jacob, Abby, Ben, and Rox are ready to go

## 🚀 How to Set Up the Database

**You need to run ONE SQL script to activate everything:**

### Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. **Open Supabase Dashboard**
   - Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard
   - Log in to your account
   - Select your project

2. **Open SQL Editor**
   - Click "SQL Editor" in the left sidebar
   - Click "New Query" button

3. **Run the Setup Script**
   - Open the file: `supabase_setup.sql` (in your project folder)
   - Copy ALL the contents
   - Paste into the SQL Editor
   - Click the "Run" button (or press Ctrl+Enter)

4. **Verify Success**
   - You should see a success message
   - Check "Table Editor" in the sidebar
   - You should see 3 new tables: `profiles`, `projects`, `project_files`

## 🎉 What Happens Next

Once the database is set up:

1. **Reload your app** - The status indicator will turn green ("AI Ready")
2. **Click Quick Create buttons** - They'll create real projects in the database
3. **Projects persist** - Refresh the page and your projects stay there
4. **Each family member** has their own profile

---

## 📊 Database Structure

### `profiles` Table
Stores family member information:
- Jacob, Abby, Ben, Rox (pre-populated)
- Each has a unique ID and avatar

### `projects` Table
Stores all creative projects:
- Title, description, type (game/app/story/art)
- Who created it
- When it was created/updated
- Thumbnail image

### `project_files` Table
Stores files attached to projects:
- File name, path, type, size
- Links to parent project

---

## 🔒 Security (Already Configured)

Row Level Security (RLS) is enabled with smart policies:

- ✅ Everyone can VIEW all projects (family sharing!)
- ✅ Only the creator can EDIT/DELETE their own projects
- ✅ Parents can manage everything (future enhancement)

---

## 🛠️ What Still Needs to Be Built

### Phase 2: AI Integration (Next Step)
- Connect to Open WebUI
- Make Quick Create buttons generate actual content
- Add voice command support

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- File upload for projects
- Project viewers (game player, story reader)
- Search and filtering
- Edit project details

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If status shows "Offline":
1. Make sure you ran the SQL setup script
2. Check that your `.env` file has valid Supabase credentials
3. Open browser console (F12) and check for errors

### If project creation fails:
1. Verify the database tables exist in Supabase
2. Check that RLS policies were created
3. Make sure you have at least one profile in the `profiles` table
