## üéñÔ∏è Core Concept

**You are a DevOps Combat Medic** - a specialized operator trained to triage and stabilize failing production systems under extreme pressure. Inspired by real combat medicine protocols, you'll apply the same life-saving principles to dying servers, bleeding databases, and critical infrastructure failures.

### The Philosophy

**Combat medicine teaches:**
- Rapid assessment (triage)
- Prioritization under pressure
- Decisive action with limited information
- Team coordination in chaos
- Learning from every incident

**This game applies those principles to:**
- System failures
- Performance degradation
- Security incidents
- Infrastructure collapse
- Production emergencies

---

## üöë Game Modes

### Campaign Mode: "Trauma to Innovations"

**Story:** You're a former military medic who became a DevOps engineer. Your company, **Command Domains**, builds critical infrastructure for families and businesses. When systems fail, lives and livelihoods are at stake.

**Progression:**
- Start as Junior DevOps Medic
- Progress through ranks (Specialist ‚Üí Sergeant ‚Üí Lieutenant ‚Üí Captain ‚Üí Commander)
- Unlock new tools, techniques, and team members
- Face increasingly complex scenarios
- Build your own "Civilian Resilience Network"

---

### Multiplayer Modes

**Co-op: Incident Response Team**
- 2-4 players
- Each player specializes (Network, Database, Application, Security)
- Coordinate to stabilize complex multi-system failures
- Real-time voice chat for tactical coordination

**PvP: Red Team vs Blue Team**
- Attackers try to take down infrastructure
- Defenders try to detect and mitigate attacks
- Realistic attack patterns (DDoS, SQL injection, zero-days)
- Scored on uptime, detection speed, mitigation effectiveness

**Hardcore Mode: Production Environment**
- Real customer traffic (simulated)
- No rollbacks
- Every decision has consequences
- Incident post-mortems affect your reputation
- Permadeath for your career (game over = start from beginning)

---

## üìä Level Design

### Level 1: Port Hemorrhage
**Scenario:** Multiple rogue processes are blocking critical ports. Your web server can't bind to port 80/443. Traffic is being dropped.

**Symptoms:**
- `EADDRINUSE` errors flooding logs
- Connection refused errors
- Customer complaints spiking
- Revenue dropping in real-time

**Tools Available:**
- `netstat` - Identify what's using ports
- `lsof` - List open files and processes
- `taskkill` / `kill` - Terminate processes
- `systemctl` - Restart services

**Objectives:**
1. Identify rogue processes (2 minutes)
2. Safely terminate them without killing critical services
3. Restore web server
4. Verify customer traffic restored

**Boss Fight: The 10,000-Connection DDoS**
- Legitimate and malicious traffic mixed
- Must implement rate limiting
- Configure firewall rules
- Deploy CDN/WAF
- All while under attack

**Success Metrics:**
- Time to resolution
- Customer impact (connections dropped)
- Collateral damage (did you kill the wrong process?)

---

### Level 2: Memory Leak Trauma
**Scenario:** Application memory usage climbing. OOM killer is about to strike. Customers experiencing slowdowns.

**Symptoms:**
- Memory usage: 85%... 90%... 95%...
- Swap thrashing
- Response times degrading
- Application becoming unresponsive

**Tools Available:**
- `top` / `htop` - Monitor resource usage
- `ps aux` - Process inspection
- Heap dumps - Analyze memory allocation
- Profilers - Identify leak sources
- Graceful restarts - Buy time

**Objectives:**
1. Identify leaking process
2. Analyze heap dump
3. Implement temporary mitigation
4. Deploy hotfix
5. Monitor for recurrence

**Boss Fight: The Infinite Loop of Death**
- Recursive function consuming all memory
- Crashes on restart
- Must patch code live
- Zero downtime requirement

---

### Level 3: Database Cardiac Arrest
**Scenario:** Database connections exhausted. Queries timing out. Deadlocks cascading. Application can't read/write data.

**Symptoms:**
- Connection pool: 0 available
- Query queue: 10,000+ waiting
- Deadlock detector firing
- Replication lag: 30 minutes
- Disk I/O: 100%

**Tools Available:**
- `SHOW PROCESSLIST` - See running queries
- `EXPLAIN` - Analyze query plans
- Index optimization
- Connection pool tuning
- Read replica failover
- Query kill commands

**Objectives:**
1. Identify slow queries
2. Kill long-running transactions
3. Optimize critical queries
4. Scale connection pool
5. Restore normal operation

**Boss Fight: The N+1 Query Cascade**
- ORM generating thousands of queries
- Each query spawns more queries
- Database melting down
- Must fix application code live
- Customers watching

---

### Level 4: Network Sepsis
**Scenario:** Packet loss spiking. Latency through the roof. DNS resolution failing. Services can't communicate.

**Symptoms:**
- Ping: 50% packet loss
- Latency: 5000ms
- DNS timeouts
- Service mesh failing
- Customer complaints: "Everything is slow"

**Tools Available:**
- `ping` - Test connectivity
- `traceroute` - Trace network path
- `tcpdump` - Capture packets
- `dig` / `nslookup` - DNS debugging
- BGP route inspection
- Failover to backup routes

**Objectives:**
1. Identify network bottleneck
2. Trace packet path
3. Diagnose DNS issues
4. Implement failover
5. Restore normal latency

**Boss Fight: The BGP Route Leak**
- ISP misconfigured routing
- Traffic going to wrong data center
- Must coordinate with external teams
- Political/communication challenge
- Time pressure: every minute = $10k lost

---

### Level 5: Kubernetes Cluster Collapse
**Scenario:** Pods crashing. Nodes failing. Cascading failure across microservices. The entire cluster is going down.

**Symptoms:**
- CrashLoopBackOff everywhere
- ImagePullBackOff (registry down)
- OOMKilled pods
- Node NotReady
- Services unreachable
- Monitoring itself is down

**Tools Available:**
- `kubectl` - Cluster management
- `helm` - Application deployment
- Node drain/cordon
- Pod eviction
- Resource quotas
- Cluster autoscaling
- Emergency runbooks

**Objectives:**
1. Triage: What's most critical?
2. Stabilize control plane
3. Evacuate pods from failing nodes
4. Restore monitoring
5. Gradually restore services
6. Prevent cascade

**Boss Fight: The Cascading Failure**
- One service failing triggers others
- Circuit breakers not configured
- Retry storms amplifying load
- Must implement chaos engineering principles
- Under fire

---

## üéÆ Gameplay Mechanics

### Triage System (Based on Real Combat Medicine)

**MARCH Protocol:**
- **M**assive hemorrhage - Stop critical failures first
- **A**irway - Ensure communication paths open
- **R**espiration - Verify services can "breathe" (process requests)
- **C**irculation - Check data flow between services
- **H**ypothermia - Prevent system degradation

**Color-Coded Triage:**
- üî¥ **Red (Immediate):** Production down, revenue loss, customer impact
- üü° **Yellow (Urgent):** Degraded performance, potential cascade
- üü¢ **Green (Delayed):** Minor issues, can wait
- ‚ö´ **Black (Expectant):** Lost data, unrecoverable, focus elsewhere

### Stress Mechanics

**Your character has stress levels:**
- **Calm (0-25%):** Clear thinking, optimal performance
- **Focused (25-50%):** Heightened awareness, faster actions
- **Stressed (50-75%):** Tunnel vision, increased error rate
- **Panicked (75-100%):** Poor decisions, typos in commands, missed details

**Stress increases from:**
- Customer complaints
- Executive pressure
- Time pressure
- Cascading failures
- Team members panicking

**Stress decreases from:**
- Successful mitigations
- Team coordination
- Clear communication
- Post-incident retrospectives
- Coffee breaks (seriously)

### Command Line Interface

**Real commands, real consequences:**
- Type actual shell commands
- Autocomplete available (but can fail under stress)
- Typos can cause damage
- `sudo rm -rf /` is possible (and catastrophic)
- Learn real DevOps tools

**Difficulty Modes:**
- **Guided:** Hints and suggestions provided
- **Realistic:** You're on your own, use docs
- **Hardcore:** No hints, production environment, one mistake = game over

### Team Management

**Build your incident response team:**
- **Network Engineer:** Specializes in connectivity, routing, DNS
- **Database Admin:** Query optimization, replication, backups
- **Security Analyst:** Threat detection, mitigation, forensics
- **Application Developer:** Code fixes, hotfixes, rollbacks
- **Site Reliability Engineer:** Automation, monitoring, chaos engineering

**Each team member has:**
- Skills (can be trained)
- Stress tolerance
- Specializations
- Personality (affects team dynamics)

### Incident Post-Mortems

**After each level:**
- Timeline reconstruction
- Root cause analysis
- What went well / What went wrong
- Action items for prevention
- Blameless culture (or not - affects team morale)

**Affects:**
- Your reputation
- Team morale
- Future incident difficulty
- Unlock new tools/techniques
